### Why do you teach it?

1. Because I believe that working in Business Intelligence and Data Science environments is one of the best things that could have happened to me, as a graduate of FNSPE. 
2. Also because I usually learn the most by preparing and giving talks to other people. **I suggest you do the same**, hence the answer to the next question.
